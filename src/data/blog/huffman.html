    Compression Algorithms</h1>
<p>We all are familiar with compression, it’s one of the glues of the
    software world, it saves us storage space, bandwidth, money, speed,
    perhaps even more. Perhaps you are thinking of the famous Winrar or Zip
    when I say compression, but the much more known and used JPEG, PNG, MP3
    are also compression systems. Broadly speaking, there are 2 major camps
    of compression, the first is lossless compression, which is based on the
    fact that real-world data is mostly non-arbitrary, meaning that we can
    find patterns patterns within the data for encoding it more succintly.
    The second camp is lossy compression, which leverages human perception
    of data, the simplest example being that while the differences of 2
    images may be imperceptible to us, one of them may take much less space
    then the other, so an algorithm can transform an image to a smaller one
    while we think they are the same.</p>
<p>In the rest of this article, I’ll build up several compression
    algorithms from the first principles, with interactive examples where
    you can see how the compression is done.</p>
<p>The simplest algorithm is a run-length encoding. In run-length
    encoding, each run(a characte repeated a number of times) is replaced
    with a length marker. As an example,</p>
<p><code>aaabbbcccc</code> becomes <code>a3b3c4</code>.</p>
<script>
    const runLengthEncode = (str) => {
        const result = [];

        let currentChar = str[0];
        let currentCount = 1;
        let i = 0

        while (i < str.length) {
            if (str[i] === currentChar) {
                currentCount++;
            } else {
                result.push([currentChar, currentCount]);
                currentChar = str[i];
                currentCount = 1;
            }
            i++;
        }

        result.push([currentChar, currentCount]);

        return result.map(([c, n]) => c + n).join("");
    }</script>
<input type="text" id="x" value="aaabbbcccc"></input>
<script>
    document.getElementById("x").addEventListener('input', function (event) {
        document.getElementById("y").innerHTML = runLengthEncode(document.getElementById("x").value)
    });
</script>
<p id="y"></p>
