Expressed in another way, the game uses the distractive objects(noises) to hide the target(signal). <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">A poorly written resume, article, poster, or portfolio is very similar to a Finding Waldo game for the reader.</strong></p><p name="c920" id="c920" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">When the author is unable to extract the signals from the noises and guide the reader with well designed indicators and pointers throughout the content, the readers has to search important pieces of information as thought they would search Waldo. <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">The most fundamental difference here is, the reader does not have to search for Waldo.</strong> They have hundreds of articles to read, resumes to review, portfolios to go through. You need to make Waldo as detectable as possible, you need to play the <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">inverse Waldo game.</strong></p><h3 name="2fea" id="2fea" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Inverse Waldo Game</h3><p name="0703" id="0703" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">Imagine you are indeed playing the game I described in abstract terms in the introduction. You are in a contest where many people submit their Waldo pictures, and the jury awards the best pictures where it is easiest to find Waldo. I would imagine you would be submitting something similar to the picture below. Maybe you would even delete the distracting background and the letters.</p><figure name="4ad1" id="4ad1" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*Z7Q0oStXoK2Bf7_MzsQItQ.png" data-width="642" data-height="498" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*Z7Q0oStXoK2Bf7_MzsQItQ.png"><figcaption class="imageCaption">Taken from: <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0213376/" data-href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0213376/" class="markup--anchor markup--figure-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0213376/</a></figcaption></figure><p name="4e65" id="4e65" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">If you need to remember a single paragraph from this article, remember the next one.</p><blockquote name="714e" id="714e" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--blockquote-strong"><em class="markup--em markup--blockquote-em">Creating content is like playing an Inverse Waldo Game. High quality content reduces noise, guides the reader throughout the signals it tries to convey. Mediocre content is often bloated, it is up to the reader to extract the signals from the sea of noises.</em></strong></blockquote><h3 name="34c3" id="34c3" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--blockquote">Understanding Signals</h3><p name="a684" id="a684" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">So far, I have talked about signals and noises as though they are terms set in stone, they aren’t. <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">They are defined with respect to the information you want to convey, qualities of the reader of the contents, and your objective in conveying this information to the reader, namely your end goal.</strong></p><blockquote name="1ad2" id="1ad2" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p">A simple rule of thumb within this framework is, you ask if adding some piece of content brings you closer to your end goal, or not. If it is not, you probably should not be adding it.</blockquote><p name="ca61" id="ca61" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote">The most obvious example I see violating this principle is people’s resumes. When creating a resume, one tends to want to stuff it with as much as they can fill in one tiny page, sometimes even filling out multiple pages. <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">If you don’t think of the content in terms of signals and noises, it is very easy to fall into the pitfall of adding anything that might be valuable. </strong>Yet, you should never forget that you are playing the Inverse Waldo Game. You should think about in terms such as <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">“Will this information help me get an interview?”, “Is this sentence important for me to coherently explain my past experiences?”, “Does adding this experience provide any relevant information regarding my potential performance in my prospective job?”</em>.</p><p name="661c" id="661c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Once one starts thinking about signals, they start thinking about the reader. <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Empathizing with the reader, writing in order to guide the reader is the key to good content creation.</strong></p><h3 name="1c2b" id="1c2b" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Less Is More</h3><p name="dd03" id="dd03" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">The central theme of the minimalism move is also one of the central principles of this article.</p><p name="e178" id="e178" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">When curating content, it is easy to add. You can set arbitrary thresholds for adding some piece or not. By nature, adding does not force you into trade-offs. On the other hand, not adding it harder. You need to decide some piece is <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">not worth</strong> adding. What is even harder is to delete. Deletion implies some piece of content you found worthy to add earlier is now unworthy. It is an implicit debate against your past self. This rigorous process acts as a natural noise filter. Deletion decides on the <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">least worthy information, </strong>effectively separating signals from the noise around them.</p><h3 name="5c09" id="5c09" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Signals Are Not Just Information</h3><p name="cb4c" id="cb4c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">I have at several points mentioned “guiding the reader throughout the content”. One might ask, <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">what is this guidance I have been talking about?</strong></p><p name="e10f" id="e10f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">Although until now, I have been talking about information, signals and noise as they are isolated pieces, they are not. A writing is not a separate set of words, as pictures are not pixels put together. <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">The whole is not the aggregation of the parts, it is the piece, their interactions with each other, as well as their interactions with the reader. </strong>That is why we have sentences, paragraphs, punctuations, bold/italics and headers. Whereas monotonicity turns the best of the signals into illegible noise, dynamicity allows for guiding the reader into what is most important. Without the hierarchy provided by these external signaling mechanisms, information itself is not enough to convey signals properly.</p></div></div></section>
