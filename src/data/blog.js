It\'s not a secret that industry pays better, but that\'s not the only relevance of money. Industry also spends more money too. Industrial labs get more clusters, more engineers,',

Before the age of mass machine manufacturing, machine produced goods were considered interesting, they were used as signals of authenticity. Yet, as mass production was generalized, cheapened, and democratized, world has seen a turn back to specialized goods. Hand-crafted items became evermore looked upon; today, unique products that "nobody else has" are more expensive, valuable, and appreciated than ever.',

    desc: 'Property Based Random Testing is a flavor of testing that aims to use higher level specifications for testing instead of hand-writing or generating tests. It was first developed by Koen Claessen and John Hughes in 1999 as a software library for Haskell, called QuickCheck. There has been substantial development in the field since then, I will not bore you with lots of details as the purpose of this writing is to familiarize you with PBT(Property Based Testing).',
