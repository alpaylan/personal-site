Before the age of mass machine manufacturing, machine produced goods were considered interesting, they were used as signals of authenticity. Yet, as mass production was generalized, cheapened, and democratized, world has seen a turn back to specialized goods.

It was first developed by Koen Claessen and John Hughes in 1999 as a software library for Haskell, called QuickCheck.
