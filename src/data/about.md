# Intro

I'm Alperen. I have many interests.
I am a [METU CENG](http://ceng.metu.edu.tr) graduate,
currently a third year Ph.D. student at [UMD CS](https://www.cs.umd.edu) advised by
[Leonidas Lampropoulos](https://lemonidas.github.io).
I do research on Property-Based Testing and Formal Verification,
I like to write on my [personal blog](https://alpkeles99.medium.com).
I also like to play chess, and do the occasional side projects.
