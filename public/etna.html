<h1 id="etna-improvements">ETNA Improvements</h1>
<p>ETNA is an evaluation and analysis platform for Property-Based
Testing Tools. It provides (1) a modular interface for adding new
languages and new testing frameworks, (2) several testing workloads
replicated in different languages, (3) experimentation primitives for
running tests and collecting results, and (4) visualization tools for
comparing the results of different tools.</p>
<p>ETNA was introduced in ICFP 2023 with the paper <a
href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3607860#sec-cit">Etna: An
Evaluation Platform for Property-Based Testing (Experience Report)</a>.
The paper describes the motivation behind ETNA, several design
considerations, as well as experiments in Coq and Haskell as case
studies. ETNA code lies in the <a
href="https://github.com/jwshii/etna">etna repository</a>.</p>
<p>The rest of this document outlines several areas of improvement we
plan to add in the future.</p>
<h2 id="improvements">Improvements</h2>
<p>First set of improvements are orthogonal to the existing ETNA
codebase. They are extensions to the existing infrastructure.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Adding new testing workloads:</strong> Adding a new testing
workload is comprised of 4 steps. (1) Picking a program/data
structure/algorithm that is amenable to property-based testing. (2)
Implementing the program as well as its specifications as property-based
tests. (3) Injecting bugs into the code. (4) Writing generators for the
data structures used in the program.</li>
<li><strong>Adding new languages:</strong> We have currently implemented
ETNA interfaces for Coq, Haskell, and Racket. Within my plans, I have
<code>Rust</code>, <code>Python</code>, <code>Typescript</code> as
potential targets in the near future. There is also some WIP work on
<code>OCaml</code>. You may also propose your favorite language to be
added.</li>
</ul>
<p>The second set of improvements are about the creating a better
infrastructure for ETNA.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Reproducible and Robust Testing:</strong> Currently, ETNA
testing infrastructure is rather fragile. We store experiment results in
JSON files and we do not keep metadata related to the tests. The plan is
to add an SQLite database backend to store the results, as well as
various test metadata such as a snapshot of the codebase for the test,
the versions of the tools used, etc.</li>
<li><strong>Robust Code Mutation Infrastructure:</strong> I have some
unfinished work on separating the code mutation system we use in ETNA as
a command-line tool. The current WIP is in <a
href="https://github.com/alpaylan/mutant-rs">this repository</a>. There
is also <a
href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/18Iroz6n5SfUtDQAmluY_FG6GEuxnIYCHlVuHf_syYn4/edit?usp=sharing">a
detailed proposal</a> for the tool. The plan is to separate the mutation
system from ETNA and make it a standalone tool that can be used in other
projects as well.</li>
<li><strong>Better Visualizations:</strong> Harry Goldstein(a postdoc
that will be at UMD next year) has created <a
href="https://harrisongoldste.in/papers/uist23.pdf">Tyche</a>, at tool
for visualizing the results of property-based testing in Hypothesis. We
plan to integrated Tyche style visualizations with ETNA, as well as
making the current visualization/analysis tools in ETNA more general and
more user-friendly.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you’re interested in getting involved with ETNA, please reach out
to me. I’m happy to help you get started with the codebase, as well as
discuss potential projects you can work on.</p>
